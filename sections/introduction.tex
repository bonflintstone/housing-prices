We used two approaches of linear regression on the same dataset for housing prices in 
 - Say a lot about housing prices, the features etc.
 - Why is it relevant?
 - What is regression? What kinda approaches are there?

Regression is a statistical machine learning approach that can be used to estimate relationships between variables; trying to predict dependent variable based on other independent variables. The most common loss function is the squared error loss funciton, but there are many different approaches and modifictions of the core linear regression idea.

 - What approaches did we choose and why?

   - Tell a lot about lasso regression, how it works, upsides, downsides
   - Tell a lot about gradient boosting regressor, how it works, upsides, downsides

 - How did we do it?
 - What is our data? How much do we have?
 - Test set split
 - Validation Methods
 - How did we test the methods?
 - What result did we arrive at (Should that already be here?)
